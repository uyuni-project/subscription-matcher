Scenario 39 - Lifecycle subscriptions counting
==============================================

This unnecessarily complex scenario tests matching Lifecycle subscriptions: 27
systems  should consume 27 Lifecycle subscriptions.

Note: Reported "Lifecycle product" is 1076: SUSE Manager Mgmt Single. In past
SUMA also reported product 1097 on top of that (SM_ENT_PROV_S product class),
but this is not the case anymore.

Result
------

27 Lifecycle subscriptions should be consumed.
