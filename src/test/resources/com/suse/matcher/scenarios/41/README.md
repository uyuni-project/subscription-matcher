Scenario 41 - Not merging equal non-OEM Subscriptions
=====================================================

See scenario 40.

Scenario 41 is different in the regard that the subscriptions here are not OEM.

In this case the subscriptions are not merged and the systems aren't covered.

Scenario
--------
- 2 systems with 4 CPUs
- 4 1-2 stackable non-OEM subscriptions with quantity = 1 covering the
  installed product

Result
------
No systems are covered.
