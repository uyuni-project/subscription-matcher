Scenario 8 - post-2015 "1-2" subscriptions do not give you a hypervisor
=======================================================================

This scenario defines a post-2015 "1-2" subscription (id 1), a SLES-based
virtualization host (id 100) with three SLES guests (id 101, 102, 103).

Result
------

"1-2" subscriptions can be assigned to VMs directly but should not
be assigned to the virtualization host, which cannot be entitled.

8.5 subscriptions should remain.
