Scenario 19 - penalties for multiple hosts
==========================================

In case a 1:2 subscription is used on multiple hosts with odd number of guests,
penalties (using 100 cents instead of 50 for one guest in order for the total
number of subscriptions per host to be round) should add up.

Result
------

We have 2 subscriptions (200 cents) that will be used on systems 100 and 200,
each with only one host (resp. 101 and 201).

Host 300 and guest 301 should remain unmatched.
