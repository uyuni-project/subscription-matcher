Scenario 11 - Pinning
=====================

This scenario defines 2 virtual hosts with either
two virtual systems on top of it.

One virtual host is a *SLES* (id 100) and the second one
is a *VMware* server (id 200).

For virtual hosts we need to map all products of all virtual
systems running on these hosts to the host to make use of
the **unlimited virtualization** option of many subscriptions.

The subscription we have in this scenario, part number
874-005030, is for product id 814 (SLES11 SP3 x86_64),
it has *unlimited virtualization* and up to 32 cpus. It
provides "Standard Support".
Part number 874-005031, has the same configuration but
provides "priority support"

Additionally we have one system in this scenario where we do
not have a subscription for (1122, RES 5).

The provided pin should match the VMware server and add the priority
support subscription to it.

Result
------

The result should be 100 consume 1 subscription of 874-005030.
200 consume 1 subscription of 874-005031
2 subscription (874-005030) are free and the system 300 can not be entitled.
