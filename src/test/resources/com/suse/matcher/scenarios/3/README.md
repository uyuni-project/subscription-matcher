Scenario 3 - SLES and RES subscription with overlapping products
================================================================

In this scenario we have 2 SLES subscriptions (part number 874-006260)
and 2 RES subscriptions (part number 874-005649).
The RES subscriptions include the possibility to use them also for SLES.

We have 4 systems, 2 with SLES11 SP3 x86_64 (ids 1000 and 2000, product
id 814) and 2 with RES 6 (id 1138). The RES subscriptions matches to
all 4 systems, while the SLES subscription matches only the 2 SLES systems.

Result
------

All systems get a subscription.
